# PyBer_Analysis
Data Analysis to help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services & determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods

## Overview of the Analysis
The analysis aims to show how the data differs by city type and based on those differences, make decisions on allocation of services in each city type.

## Results
Let's look at the PyBer Summary DataFrame and the Total Fare by City Type Line Chart:\

Among the three city types, PyBer is most popular in urban cities.  Urban cities have the most number of rides (1,625).  They also have the most number of drivers (2,405), therefore PyBer is able to meet rider demand much better, resulting to lower ride fares.  This also means lower average fares for drivers.  As you move further away from the larger cities, and into the suburban & rural cities, the the number of rides becomes fewer (625 & 125, respectively) & the number of drivers decrease (490 and 78, respectively).  PyBer does the best in urban cities with the highest total fare at about $39,900 in 2019.  Suburban city PyBer rides made about $19,400 and rural city rides made only about $4,300, despite the higher fare per ride.

## Summary 
Based on the results, three business recommendations to address the disparities among the city types are:
- Partner with the communities in underserved neighborhoods to market the benefits of ride-sharing.
- Provide incentives to drivers to accept rides in suburban and rural cities.
- Provide one or two travel tips within the app regarding the destinations, especially in the surrounding suburban & rural areas.  This gives inspiration to riders in revisiting those city types.
